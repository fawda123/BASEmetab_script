![A direct comparison of gas exchange estimates from the EBASE and Odum models. The 1:1 line is dotted and the regression line is solid. The R-squared values for each regression are shown at the top next to the month.](images/gasexcmp.jpg)

![Continuous time series of all metabolic parameters from the EBASE and Odum models. Each point is a weekly average of all continuos estimates. The R-squared values for the regressions between results for each model are shown at the top next to the parameter labels.](images/weeklyts.jpg)
