Modficatoin of materials for running BASEmetab.  All content derived from the original repository [here](https://github.com/dgiling/BASEmetab).

* `script1.R` My horrible attempt at running BASEmetab by pulling out only the relevant code, including excessive butchering of the model script (`BASE_metab_model_v2.3.txt`)

* `script2.R` A better attempt at running BASEmetab using the original package

* `R/method_comp.R` Comparisons of Odum and BASEmetab methods for the different attempts

* `R/dat_proc.R` Data prep for interoperability between packages
