Modification of materials for running BASEmetab.  All content derived from the original repository [here](https://github.com/dgiling/BASEmetab).

See [comparison plots](https://fawda123.github.io/BASEmetab_script/comp_plots) for comparison of metabolism results by different methods.

* `script1.R` Run stripped down BASEmetab code

* `script2.R` Run BASEmetab using the original package

* `script3.R` Run stripped down BASEmetab code with instantaneous K

* `script4.R` Run stripped down BASEmetab code with instantaneous K and metabolic day

* `script5.R` Run stripped down BASEmetab code with instantaneous K, metabolic day, p and theta estimated

* `R/method_comp.R` Comparisons of Odum and BASEmetab methods for the different attempts

* `R/dat_proc.R` Data prep for interoperability between packages
